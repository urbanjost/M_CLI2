how to set then environment variable A to the value 100 only when
the lfortran compiler is being used in the github action workflow in
https://github.com/urbanjost/M_CLI2/.github/workflows/CI.yml

To set the environment variable A to 100 only when the
lfortran compiler is used in the GitHub Actions workflow in
https://github.com/urbanjost/M_CLI2/.github/workflows/CI.yml, you need
to modify the workflow file to conditionally set the variable based on
the compiler being used. The CI.yml file in the M_CLI2 repository uses
a matrix strategy to test multiple compilers, including lfortran. Below
is a step-by-step guide to achieve this.

Steps to Modify the Workflow

    Identify the Compiler in the Workflow: The CI.yml file uses a matrix
    strategy with a compiler variable that includes lfortran among others
    (e.g., gfortran, ifort). You can check the value of the compiler
    matrix variable to determine when lfortran is being used.

    Set the Environment Variable Conditionally: Use the if condition in
    a step to set the environment variable A to 100 only when the matrix
    variable compiler is lfortran. This can be done by appending to the
    $GITHUB_ENV file, which is the recommended way to set environment
    variables in GitHub Actions.

    Update the Workflow File: Modify the CI.yml file to include a
    step that checks the compiler and sets the environment variable
    A accordingly.

Example Modification

Assuming the CI.yml file in
https://github.com/urbanjost/M_CLI2/.github/workflows/CI.yml looks
something like this (based on typical GitHub Actions workflows for
Fortran projects), hereâ€™s how you can add the conditional environment
variable setting:
yaml

name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        compiler: [gfortran, lfortran, ifort]
      fail-fast: false

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Fortran environment
        run: |
          # Commands to install the compiler based on matrix.compiler
          case ${{ matrix.compiler }} in
            gfortran)
              sudo apt-get update
              sudo apt-get install -y gfortran
              ;;
            lfortran)
              # Install lfortran (specific installation steps)
              pip install lfortran
              ;;
            ifort)
              # Install ifort (specific installation steps)
              ;;
          esac

      - name: Set environment variable A for lfortran
        if: matrix.compiler == 'lfortran'
        run: echo "A=100" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Build and test
        run: |
          # Use the compiler to build and test
          make FC=${{ matrix.compiler }}
          # Use the environment variable A if needed
          echo "Value of A is: $A"

Explanation of Changes

    Conditional Step: The step named Set environment variable A for
    lfortran uses the if: matrix.compiler == 'lfortran' condition to
    execute only when the compiler matrix variable is lfortran. This
    ensures the environment variable A is set only for the lfortran
    compiler.

    Setting the Environment Variable: The command echo "A=100" >>
    $GITHUB_ENV appends the environment variable A with the value 100
    to the $GITHUB_ENV file, making it available to subsequent steps in
    the same job. This is the standard way to set environment variables
    in GitHub Actions.

    Accessing the Variable: In later steps, you can access the environment
    variable A using $A in shell commands or ${{ env.A }} in GitHub
    Actions expressions. For example, the Build and test step includes
    echo "Value of A is: $A" to demonstrate accessing the variable.

Notes

    Verify Compiler Installation: Ensure the lfortran installation step
    (pip install lfortran in the example) matches the actual setup used
    in the M_CLI2 repository. You may need to adjust this based on the
    specific installation instructions for lfortran.

    Scope of the Environment Variable: The environment variable A set via
    $GITHUB_ENV is available only within the job where it is set. If you
    need A to be available across multiple jobs, you would need to use
    job outputs or repository variables, but this is likely unnecessary
    for your use case since the compiler-specific steps are typically
    within a single job.

    Matrix Variable: The example assumes the matrix variable is named
    compiler. If the CI.yml file uses a different name (e.g., fc or
    fortran_compiler), replace matrix.compiler with the correct variable
    name (e.g., matrix.fc).

    Testing the Change: After modifying the CI.yml file, push the changes
    to a branch and create a pull request to trigger the workflow. Check
    the workflow logs to ensure that A=100 is set only when lfortran is
    used (e.g., by inspecting the output of echo "Value of A is: $A").

If You Need to Check the Original CI.yml

If you want me to tailor this solution more precisely to the CI.yml
file in https://github.com/urbanjost/M_CLI2/.github/workflows/CI.yml,
please provide the relevant content of that file (or confirm it matches
the structure above). Alternatively, I can attempt to fetch and analyze
the file directly, but since the repository is public, the above example
should align with common Fortran CI workflows.

Additional Considerations

    Error Handling: If lfortran requires specific handling for the
    variable A, ensure that its usage in the make command or other steps
    is compatible with how lfortran expects environment variables.

    Documentation: The GitHub Actions documentation on environment
    variables and the $GITHUB_ENV file provides further details on
    managing variables.
