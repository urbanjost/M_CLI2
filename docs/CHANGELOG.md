     and treat dash and underscore as equivalent characters in keywords

### :green_circle: ADD:
   + Developer debug mode can be invoked by setting the environment
     variable $CLI_DEBUG_MODE to TRUE.
### :red_circle: FIX:
   + The default response file on MSWindows in some environments 
     had to be named PROGRAM_NAME.exe.rsp instead of PROGRAM_NAME.rsp,
     contrary to the documentation. The ".exe" is, as intended, not
     used or required anymore.

### :red_circle: FIX:
   + locate_c did not calculate the correct number of tries to locate
     keywords in the dictionary on 32-bit platforms because INT() was
     being used instead of NINT().
